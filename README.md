## 📘 Project Overview

This notebook-based data science project explores the **relationship between life expectancy and health spending per capita** across different countries. By visualizing this connection, we aim to answer one simple, yet powerful question:

> 💡 *Does spending more on healthcare actually help people live longer?*

With clean data, beautiful plots, and a bit of statistical magic, we peel back the layers behind public health outcomes.

## 🌱 Significance of the Project

Health is wealth — but is wealth health?

This project sits at the intersection of economics and epidemiology. Its insights can:

- 🎯 Inform policy makers on global health investment outcomes
- 🌐 Encourage equitable spending based on health returns
- 📊 Serve as a teaching tool for budding data scientists
- 💬 Spark conversations around efficiency vs. expenditure

From classroom to conference room, this notebook has value.
